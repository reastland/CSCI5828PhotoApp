There are a few different Instagram APIs out there for Java. It seems that the most recent one is called jInstragram (https://github.com/sachin-handiekar/jInstagram). I have no idea if it is better or worse than any of the others.

Getting it to work with our project was a pain, but I think that I got there. If you are good at this kind of thing, you might not need these instructions, but I thought I would write this down in case it can save you time. You won’t be able to use the Instagram Java API until you get this set up correctly. I can try to help if this doesn’t work. 

These steps assume that you have already set up your CSCI5828.PhotoApp project in Eclipse and checked out the repository from GitHub (https://github.com/reastland/CSCI5828PhotoApp). 

You need to install three external jar files. I’ve downloaded them all and they can be found in this Drive folder in the directory GitHub Libraries.

jInstagram-master
scribe-java-master
gson-2.3

The first two need to be compiled first. Here is how to do that (assumes that you have Maven installed). I created a folder called \libs (C:\libs) where I stored everything.:

Copy the two zip files and the gson-2.3.jar file to this folder.
Extract the two zip files.
Open a terminal
For each of the two that you extracted the zip files:
Navigate to those folders so that you are immediately inside of it.
type “mvn package”
Note: this is how I did it. There are probably other ways (like ‘mvn compile’) that might work, so if you have a better way, use it.
This created a bunch of jar files. We have to add two of them to the project libraries.
/libs/jInstragram-master/target/jInstagram-1.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
/libs/gson-2.3.jar
In Eclipse, right click on the project at the top of the Project Navigator pane. Select Properties.
Click on the Libraries tab
Click on Add External JARs
Select both of those jar files
